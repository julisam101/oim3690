## Session 5 - 02/03 - HTML Essentials 

## What I learned: 
- Domain Name System: it's a big table that covers IP address, domain name, etc. 
- IP Address (it’s a set of 4 numbers) can't be used directly b/c it's hard to remember
- HTTP Status Code 404: error, cannot find 
- HTTP Status Code 200: success 
- When you view a webpage, the files that your browser downloads are HTML but under the section of “network” there’s a whole list that downloads   
- When you click on "Cookies", the webpage assigns you an id number in which they can recognize how often you go on their page
- THe difference between GET and POST: 
            - GET: asking, retrieving information, the files that are downloaded (it's used the most)
            - POST: used to submit, sending data to the backend in hopes that they would do something with your data
                  - mainly used when filling out forms, you don't want your info to save in the downloads section
- one can copy the IP address number, paste it on the web, and it should bring you to the direct page
- tracert: every "hop" (router) between you and the destination, how many steps it takes to reach the serve, shows the physical journey of your data across the interent 
    - very similar to your commute to Logan Airport, in the sense that there are many ways of getting there 
    - it takes x amount of hops to get to your final destination 
- ping: tests if a server is reachable 
- client side (frontend)
        - runs in the browser
- server side (backend)
        - runs on the server 
        - python, node, PHP
        - data processing, databases
- HTML: structure and content, its the skeleton  (text, header, paragraph)
- CSS: styling and layout, the clothes (widgets, images, how does it look, size, color)
- JavaScript: behavior and interactivity, the msucles (movements, animations)
- Elements: HTML structure and CSS styles
- Console: JavaScript errors and output
- Netowrk: HTTP request and responses
- Sources

## Questions that were asked by students:
- Meta means information of information 
- the tag "class": you can name it however, that means you have to change every tag with "class"
