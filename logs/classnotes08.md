CSS Esessentials: [Cascading Style Sheets]
- controls how HTMl elemnts look: 
        - colors and fonts
        - Spacing and layout
        - Animations and effects 
- without CSS, websites would be plain text with default broswer styling


3 Ways to Add CSS:
        1. External (it's recommended because it's easy to find and can use the same layout for multiple pages so you don't have to rewrite the same code over and over again)
        2. Interal
        3. Include (avoid)
      

- so when you have a HTML file and an CSS file, the priority of colors/fonts/layout will be the latest code as it overrides it

Why "Cascading"?
- when multiple styles conflic, CSS follows this priority: 
        1. include styles (highest priorty) 
        2. internal/external stylesheets (last one wins)
        3. browser defaults (lowest priority)
        4. more specific selectors also win over less specific ones
