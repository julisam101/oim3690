## Class Notes - Session 16 (3/24) 


 - script is the last part of the body b/c if JavaScript doesn't work then the content of the website will still work
 - How does Java fint HTML elements on the page? 
    - it's by using the beginning of the script, by using the ID 


- JavaScript: 
    - make it do things 
    - respond to clicks and input
    - change content dynamically
    - fetch data from server 
    - build interactive applications

- Adding JavaScript to HTML: 
    - at the bottom of body, which is recommended 
    - body is for HTML 
    - script section is for JavaScript code 
    - ... later one can use external files


- style section is for CSS
- script section is for JavaScript


- What is DOM? 
    - when the browser loads HTML, it builds a tree in memory called the DOM
    - JavaScript can read and change this tree 

- One can use (document.querySelector) function with any CSS selector -> can be done by tag, class and ID 

- What is an Event? 
    - events are actions that happen on the page
    - user clicks a button
    - user types in an input
    - mouse hovers over an element
    - Java can listen and read the events 
    "when something happens, do this" -> thats the event
    - try to combine the event to element 
    - ** ex: when click happens on the buttom, do all this xyz ** 

    1. document.querySelector(): finds elements on the page
    2. addEventListener('click',...): waits for a click
    3. Inside the function: changes text, styles, or classses
