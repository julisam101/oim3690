- Review Questions: 
    - you friend's <img> won't center even though they added margin: 0 auto, What's the fix and why? 
            - so you would need to add  display : block so it can convert it or else it assumes it's part of the text 

    - If you asked AI "how do i center a div", would the same answer work for an image? 
            - so AI would put the corner in the center of the midpoint which is not the actual center. So it would at 50% of width and 50% height to get it to the center
