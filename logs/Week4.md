# Week 4 [2/10-2/12] - 

## What I learned this week
- This week I learned that CSS can be intergrated with HTML. I thought that because they were two different coding styles that they can only be used separately. However, when we were closely analzying our portfolio page, there was CSS incorporated into the HTML. Seeing how the two different coding styles can act indepedently and dependently helped me better understand the function of the two. 
- Additionally, if there are two files (HTML and CSS), the computer reads and follows the last style of code. So in this case the last one wins. This session really allowed me to truly understand what each line of code does and how to properly manipulate them.

## Code I'm Proud of 

## Challenges I faced
- For the "about me" section, I have bullet points under my bullet points. So the set under the main bullet points, I couldn't seem to find a way to change the color. The color defaults to all the bullets however, what I want to do is separate the main bullet point header from the bullet point body. I have tried asking AI but it spits out this long, overly complicated lines of code.

## AI Usage (if any)

## Questions Going Forward

## App/Website Idea
- how well my friends/family know me, moving random facts to either true or false section
    - the level gets difficult as they progression
