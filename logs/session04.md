## Session 4 - 1/29 - How Web Works 

## What I learned today
- The differences between websites. Simple websites entail personal portfolios, blogs, etc. While interactive web apps include calculator, to do lists, etc. I would categorize all websites under the same umbrella so it was nice seeing how they can all differentiate and the level of coding/technique each require.
- I learned the anatomy of a URL. I would simply type canvas or google and the URL would simply pop up. I never paid much attention to it however, seeing how the different aspects interact with eachother and the break down of it, it's all starting to make sense. 

## Challenges I Face 
- The main challenge I faced was working on my website. Initially, I had the code on my oim3690 folder which was completely wrong. Once, I made the switch, it made it a lot easier to make edits. Additionally, I was trying to add my resume in pdf form to my website. I had to manually change the file name at least 5 times before the program accepted it. All in short, it was all trial and error. 


## Code/work I'm proud of
- I was able to incorporate video links and pdf's to my personal website. I was having issuing with the file names and the location however, once I was able to bypass it, it made my website ten times better.
