# What I Learned:

- responsive design: when you change the size of the screen, it changes the layou to the content
- if the website is broken,
  - when you expect the link to work one way but it's the opposite
    - solution: right click and click on inspect, often times you need to add the https://
    - if it doesn't have the https:// the computer reads it as a file and not an actual link
  - the server is not loading properly

- HyperTextMarkupLanguage Essentials:
  - ** control shift P
  - ''' using three quotes allows you to copy code without it actually thinking it's code 
  - the equal sign means signing value from the left side to the right side 
  - the letter a stands for anchor 
  - angle bracklets stands for markup 
  - the letter p stands for paragraphs 
  - img stands for images
  - div stands for generic container 



# Some Challenges for the day:
