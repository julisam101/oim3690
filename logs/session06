What I Learned:

- responsive design: when you change the size of the screen, it changes the layou to the content
- if the website is broken,
  - when you expect the link to work one way but it's the opposite
    - solution: right click and click on inspect, often times you need to add the https://
    - if it doesn't have the https:// the computer reads it as a file and not an actual link
  - the server is not loading properly

- HTML Essentials:
  - ** control shift P
