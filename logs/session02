## Session 2 - 1/22 - Introduction to Version Control and GitHub

## What I learned today: 

- I learned the purpose of GitHub and how to properly install the software. Often times, I am used to simply just dowloading the app and logging in. I didn't think it would be so complex to install and prepare. This definitely opened up my eyes to the different ways in which coding is presented. 

## Challenges I Faced: 

- Setting up the two different GitHub accounts was difficult. I assumed that they were both going to be set under one account with two separate folders. However, by asking the classmates nearby I was able to get clarification.
