# Week 5[2/24 and 2/26]


## What I learned this week
- This week I learned about the CS selectors and flexbox. This definitely helped me understand how and why certain websites are set up the way they are. I learned more components on how to properly make my website stand out. Additionally, learning about the box model was helpful and seeing how each content interact with eachother. As of right now, my mini project website looks too far apart which through off the layout. By learning about the box model, it's helping me properly move my content together, in a way that makes sense. Also, the code root and using defined variables. It makes changing color, font, size, etc. so much easier and now it's no longer time consuming. All in all, this week I learned every specific lines of code that are crucial to the layout of the website and the content. 

## Code I'm Proud of 
- The Froggy game was so much fun and I learned a lot! I am proud that I was able to complete that task a lot faster than the CS Diner. Additionally, for my mini project, it's becoming a lot easier creating sheets (both HTML and CSS). I know how to connect both sheets and at least write the first half of code without having to rely too much on my notes.


## Challenges I faced
- How to properly use the flex, container, text align, etc. lines of code. Playing the games definitely helped out to understanding what they do however, I am a bit confused on how to incorporate them into our code. The challenge I faced was incorporating the lines of code we learned in class to my projects. 

## AI Usage (if any)
- I used AI for my miniproject 1 just to help outline effective ways in building out transportation routes. I have about 10-15 places, some locations have similar routes so rather than writing the lines of code over and over again, I had asked it to help me find a "short cut". 

## Questions Going Forward
- The topics that we have covered, all the coding will be placed into our CSS folders. I am having trouble understanding where certain lines of code will go and when & where to connect them.
