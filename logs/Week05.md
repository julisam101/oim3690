# Week 5[2/19]


## What I learned this week
- I learned more about the CSS and how to properly use it to its full advantage. There are several ways in which one choose a color, font, style, etc. There isn't just one way of getting to your "ideal website" but rather different ways and it was fun exploring how those different ways interact with each other. 

## Code I'm Proud of 
- I am proud of knowing when and how to manipulate CSS. As simple as it may seem, being able to understand how each part of the code functions, makes changing and creating new lines of code easier. Overtime, I have been able to see how one little change can effect the lines of code.

## Challenges I faced
- I had trouble changing the colors of the body of my ordered list. However, the lesson on ID and * made it easier to change those colors. 

## AI Usage (if any)

## Questions Going Forward
- So I have my interview questions already completed, do I upload the link on Canvas or should the link be sent to your directly. 

## App/Website Idea
